            <h2>Support the Food Pantry</h2>
        <p>Searching for a way to contribute to our mission? Look no further! Our hive supporters are one of the many reasons why we are able to successfully maintain the operation of the Food Pantry. At this time, the Food Pantry can be supported in a variety of ways. Check out the options below to learn more about how you can contribute.</p>

        <h3>Food and Item Donations</h3>
        <p>At this time, the Food Pantry can only accept non-perishable food, sealed and unopened toiletry or hygienic items, and new or gently used kitchen essentials. Donations can be dropped off while the Food Pantry is open. If you wish to make a donation during a time when the Food Pantry is closed, please reach out to Wilson Commons Student Activities to coordinate a time for delivery.</p>
        <p>We are always in need of food items, such as, breakfast cereal, oatmeal, and bars, pasta, pasta sauce, jelly spread, soups, canned fruits and vegetables, as well as, gluten free and vegan alternatives. Consider keeping your food donations healthy by choosing products that are whole grain, reduced sodium, and packaged in water or 100% juice. For a list of specific items we are in need of, please browse the Food Pantry’s Amazon Wishlist.</p>

        <h3>Monetary Donations</h3>
        <p>Monetary donations are accepted through the University of Rochester’s Crowdfunding Portal. To make a monetary donation to the Food Pantry, click this link. All monetary donations given to the Food Pantry help us continue to fund the operations of the Pantry, including: purchasing additional food or supplies when inventory gets low and paying our student employees who work hard to serve their peers.</p>
        <p>Thank you in advance for your generous contributions and for making a direct impact on student experience.</p>

        <h3>Host a Collection Drive</h3>
        <p>We are excited to collaborate with other University of Rochester departments and student organizations as a means of raising funds, food, and toiletry items for the Pantry. You can work with us and sponsor our Food Pantry by organizing and implementing your own collection drive or collecting items within your space as part of our organized food drives.</p>
        <p>While the planning of the Collection Drive is up to you, we are happy to assist with information on best practices, provide logos and information for your marketing, and assist with advertisement, along with providing a specially branded Food Pantry collection bin for your event.</p>
        <p>If you are a Student Organization looking to host a Collection Drive, complete an Activity Registration submission through CCC. If you are a Department that would like to host a Collection Drive, please email Wilson Commons Student Activities with “Food Pantry Collection Drive” in the subject line.</p>
