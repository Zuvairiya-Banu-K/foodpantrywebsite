            <h2>About the Food Pantry</h2>
            <p>The Food Pantry is dedicated to challenging the rising issue of student food insecurity on campus by supporting and serving all students and postdocs at the University of Rochester. Individuals can browse and choose non-perishable items during the Pantry’s operation hours in 105 Wilson Commons, or pre-order a bag for pick up. Check out our FAQs below for additional information or e-mail us at foodpantry@rochester.edu.</p>
            <h3>FAQ's</h3>
            <p><strong>Who should be using the Food Pantry?</strong><br>
            While the Food Pantry is need-blind and does not require income or financial aid information to be served, in order to be able to make our supplies last and meet the current high demand, we ask that you consider whether the Food Pantry is right for you. The Food Pantry should be used by any students or postdocs who is food insecure or may be facing a change in employment status.</p>

            <p><strong>What if I am not available to pick up my bag?</strong><br>
            See if a friend is willing to pick up your bag for you. Call or send us an e-mail to let us know who will be picking up on your behalf.</p>

            <p><strong>What if I am in need of support for other basic needs?</strong><br>
            Please visit the Basic Needs Hub to access other resources.</p>

            <p><strong>How can I continue to support the Food Pantry?</strong><br>
            At this time, the Food Pantry can be supported in a variety of ways. Support our Crowdfunding effort and make a monetary donation online. Donations can also be made via our Amazon Wishlist. Food items on Amazon currently go in and out of stock quickly. As long as the item is non-perishable – we’ll take it! Drop off extra goods from your home pantry during our operation hours. For after hour deliveries, please reach out to Wilson Commons Student Activities.</p>
